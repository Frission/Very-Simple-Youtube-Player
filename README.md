# Very-Simple-Youtube-Player
 Learning how to use a third party API by using Youtube Data API to launch a Youtube video as an activity, or in a standalone player.
 
 The starting activity has two buttons:
 
 Play a Single Video button launches a Youtube Video as a YoutubePlayerView, which also means I can receive Play and Pause events inside my code.

The Standalone Sub Menu launches another activity with two buttons. The first one plays a single video, and the second one plays a playlist. 
Both these buttons in the Standalone Activity launch Youtube Player as a Standalone Activity by using Intents.
